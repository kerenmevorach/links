                A collection of media surrounding nostalgic games that ran on Adobe Flash until it's overdue (but bittersweet) death in 2021. These now defunct games shaped my childhood, and are the progenitor for my later and current interests. This collection features screen caps of games, gameplay videos, websites, articles discussing the impact of Flash games on the gaming industry as well as grassroots efforts to preserve or locate these games lost to time.
